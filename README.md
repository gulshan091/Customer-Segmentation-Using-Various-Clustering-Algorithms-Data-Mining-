# Customer-Segmentation-Using-Various-Clustering-Algorithms-Data-Mining
We have done the customer segmentation using two Clustering Algorithms-
1)KMeans
2)Hierarchical Clustering
Conclusion-
Comparing the two silhouette scores:
The silhouette score for KMeans (0.4277914482997785) is higher than that of Agglomerative Clustering (0.34004455159841124). This suggests that, according to the silhouette score metric, the clusters formed by KMeans are relatively better separated and more distinct than those formed by Agglomerative Clustering.
